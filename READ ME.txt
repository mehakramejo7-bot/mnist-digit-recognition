# MNIST Digit Recognition

This project implements a machine learning model to recognize handwritten
digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset.

## Task Description
The goal is to preprocess MNIST handwritten digit images, train a model
to classify digits from 0 to 9, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset
MNIST handwritten digit dataset (IDX format).

## Methodology
- Loaded MNIST IDX image and label files
- Normalized image pixel values
- Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Trained the model with early stopping
- Evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Results
- Test Accuracy: **99.21%**
- Test Loss: **0.0226**
- Total Misclassified Images: **79 out of 10,000**

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
2. Ensure MNIST files are placed in the correct directory
3. Run all cells
